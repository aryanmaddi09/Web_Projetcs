# Django🐍

> Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.


### Main features

* Separated dev and production settings

* Example app with custom user model

* SQLite by default if no env variable is set

# Usage

To use this template to start your own project:

### Existing virtualenv

If your project is already in an existing python3 virtualenv first install django by running

    $ pip install django
    
And then run the `django-admin.py` command to start the new project:

    $ django-admin.py startproject \
      --template=https://github.com/nikola-k/django-template/zipball/master \
      --extension=py,md \
      <project_name>
      
### No virtualenv

This assumes that `python3` is linked to valid installation of python 3 and that `pip` is installed and `pip3`is valid
for installing python 3 packages.

Installing inside virtualenv is recommended, however you can start your project without virtualenv too.

If you don't have django installed for python 3 then run:

    $ pip3 install django
    
And then:

    $ python3 -m django startproject <project_name>
      
      
After that just install the local dependencies, run migrations, and start the server.
